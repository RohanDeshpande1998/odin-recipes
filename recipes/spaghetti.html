    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat and water and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum wheat semolina.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1Â¾ cups grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Scoop out some of the cooking water and reserve. Drain spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and pepper; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add spaghetti and Pecorino Romano cheese. Ladle in 1/2 cup of reserved cooking water; stir until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Add more cooking water until sauce coats spaghetti, about 1 minute more.</li>
    </ol>
